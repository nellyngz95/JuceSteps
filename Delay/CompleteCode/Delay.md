Here's the delay processor and editor code. 
Important bits of the code. 
* Audio Processor Value TreeState
* Circular Buffer -> Prepare to play
* Circular Buffer-> Process Block
* Be aware to update the read and write positions.

  NotE: There are other ways to create a delay E.g: Using juce::dsp module :)
